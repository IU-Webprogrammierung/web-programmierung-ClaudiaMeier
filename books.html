                <h3 class="single_heading">Michelle Adams - Hidden Treasures</h3>
                <p>Once upon a time, in a small village in southern France, a pretty, willful English girl is falling in
                    love. Frances Langley has fallen under Benoit's romantic spell, so sure is she that he is everything
                    she's ever wanted—a self-assured, sexy man, experienced and just a little bit mysterious. But
                    Frances is hiding a secret—one that would surely separate them if he ever knew the truth. And to
                    hold on to his love, she is willing to do anything for him, even put herself at risk by hiding a
                    precious object, stolen by the Nazis decades before.
                    Years later, Frances's son, Harry, opens the door of his late mother's home, never expecting to see
                    Tabitha—the lost love of his life—on the other side. Their angry parting had broken his heart, but
                    now she holds a letter, sent by his mother just before her death, begging the pair to
                    search—together—for a priceless jewelry box, hidden somewhere in her little Cotswold cottage.
                    Harry quickly dismisses the search, but as an art historian, Tabitha cannot risk the chance to
                    recover something so valuable that was long thought to be lost. And so they embark on a journey of
                    discovery, but soon find themselves searching for much more than a missing piece of art. Together
                    they learn that the true riches are not those buried in the clutter of Francis' cottage, but are
                    instead the treasures they each hold, buried deep inside their hearts.

                    <h3>Paulo Coelho - The Alchemist</h3>
                    <p>Combining magic, mysticism, wisdom, and wonder into an inspiring tale of self-discovery, The
                        Alchemist has become a modern classic, selling millions of copies worldwide and transforming the
                        lives of countless readers. Paulo Coelho's masterpiece tells the mystical story of Santiago, an
                        Andalusian shepherd boy who longs to travel in search of a worldly treasure. His quest leads him
                        to
                        riches far different—and far more fulfilling — than he ever imagined. Santiago's journey teaches
                        us
                        the wisdom of listening to our hearts, recognizing opportunity, and learning to read the omens
                        along
                        life's path. Most importantly, it shows us the value of following our dreams.</p>

                    <h3>Brianna Wiest - The Mountain Is You</h3>
                    <p> This book explores the concept of self-sabotage—why we do it, when we do it, and how to break
                        free
                        from it for good. Conflicting needs create self-sabotaging behaviors, often making change seem
                        futile. But by gaining insight into our damaging habits, understanding our brains and bodies,
                        releasing past traumas, and learning to act as our highest selves, we can move beyond our own
                        obstacles. For centuries, the mountain has symbolized the big challenges we face, especially
                        those
                        that seem insurmountable. To climb these mountains, we must do the deep internal work of
                        healing,
                        building resilience, and adjusting how we approach life. In the end, we do not master the
                        mountain,
                        but ourselves.</p>

                        essays
                        offer profound reflections on why you should prioritize purpose over passion, embrace negative
                        thinking, see the value in daily routines, and become aware of the cognitive biases that shape
                        your
                        perception of the world. Some of these essays have never been published before, while others
